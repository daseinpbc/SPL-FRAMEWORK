# Arkin Theory Foundation

This document explains the robotics principles that form the theoretical foundation of SPL.

## Ronald Arkin: Behavior-Based Robot Control (1987+)

- **Modular reactive schemas** for autonomous decision-making
- **Hierarchical suppression** for scalable agent design
- **Explainability by design** (every behavior is traceable)
- **Inherent safety** (constraints built into architecture)

## Rodney Brooks: Subsumption Architecture (1986)

- **Bottom-up design:** Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Reactive layers** suppress deliberative layers
- **Proven in 50M+ deployed robots**

## Application to Foundation Model Agents

All principles now apply to foundation model agents:

- **Cost efficiency** through reactive-first design
- **Safety** via built-in architectural constraints
- **Explainability** through layered decision-making
- **Scalability** via multi-agent pattern sharing
